✅ Module 5 Assignment

📜 Scenario

Now that the product listing and detail pages are set up, you will implement authentication, CRUD operations, and an
admin dashboard to manage products. This module will focus on advanced Next.js concepts, including middleware, state
management, and unit testing.

📁 Requirements

You are required to implement:

1. Authentication & Middleware:

* Fetch users from FakeStoreAPI.
* Implement authentication for the login process.
* Restrict the Checkout Page to authenticated users using middleware.

1. Shopping Cart & Checkout Page:

* Implement cart functionality using Context API, Zustand or Redux.
* Persist cart data using localStorage.
* Display cart summary and a checkout button.

1. Admin Dashboard (CRUD with API Routes & ISR):

* Create an admin panel where users can view, add, edit, and delete products.
* Implement API Routes for CRUD operations.
* Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to update pages dynamically.

1. Unit Testing & Performance Optimization:

* Write unit tests for components using Jest & React Testing Library.
* Optimize performance with lazy loading, caching, and custom hooks.

🚀 Deliverables

For this checkpoint, you are required to submit:

1. Deployed Website: An updated version of your e-commerce store with full functionality.
2. Source Code Repository: The complete Next.js project on GitHub.
3. Project Documentation (README file) including:

* Overview of the project
* Features implemented (including authentication & admin panel)
* Technologies used
* Screenshots or demo links

🔍 Grading Component

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

✅ Authentication & Middleware

* Implements authentication for the login process.
* Uses middleware to restrict access to protected routes.
* Manages user authentication state correctly.
* Redirects unauthorized users to the login page.

✅ Advanced State Management

* Uses Context API, Zustand or Redux for global state handling.
* Implements persistent state using localStorage / cookies.
* Updates cart state correctly based on user actions.
* Handles state updates efficiently without unnecessary re-renders.

✅ CRUD & API Fetching

* Implements API routes for product management (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Ensures secure handling of API requests and responses.
* Uses form validation to prevent invalid submissions.
* Updates UI dynamically when CRUD actions are performed.

✅ ISR & Performance Optimization

* Implements Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic updates.
* Optimizes fetch requests with caching strategies.
* Ensures good performance through custom hooks or split loading.

✅ Front-end Unit Testing

* Writes unit tests using Jest & React Testing Library with minimum coverage 50%.
* Tests key functionalities like authentication and API calls.
* Ensures no major errors in production build.
